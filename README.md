## Django REST API 

This is a first attempt at building a Django REST API for MRI images stored in a Posgresql database.

It is comprised of two apps:

1. customer. A test app for creating a customer database with name, E-Mail and ID
2. cabezas. The proper MRI database with REST services for reading and adding images.
